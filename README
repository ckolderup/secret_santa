Usage:
----

1. create a 'people' CSV file with the following fields:

  ID,NAME,DETAILS,EMAIL ADDRESS,EXCLUSIONS

  the "DETAILS" field will generally contain a mailing address but can include other instructions. HTML <br> tags are supported.
  the "EXCLUSIONS" field should be a semicolon-separated list of ids (from the first column) signifying people that the person should not be assigned to give a gift to.

2. create a 'template' text file. Use the following %%DOUBLE_PERCENT_DELIMITED%% variable names in the template to substitute the specifics for a given email to a particular person:

  %%NAME%% : used to address the person receiving the email
  %%GIVING_TO%% : used to give the name of the person they're giving a gift to
  %%DETAILS%% : the DETAILS field from the CSV, usually the mailing address to send the gift to


3. You can test the assignments via `rake test_assign people.csv`, and once you're confident that you have your people file configured correctly with all exclusions, you can send the emails with `rake email_assign people.csv email.txt`.
